We are a research group that is interested in some of the fundamental questions in modern machine learning. We are interested in approaches that advance our understanding through both experimental and theoretical means. Our group includes machine learning practitioners, theoretical computer scientists, and statisticians, all with the goal of putting machine and deep learning on firmer ground and elucidating their fundamental capabilities and limitations.

We do a lot of seminar, concerning with deep learning. 

In addition, we host a research-level seminar series on recent advances in the field. Join the seminar mailing list to receive announcements about upcoming talks.

We are looking for graduate students and machine learning practitioners.
